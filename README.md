# Fractal Images Generated Using Rust

This is a personal project for me to learn using the Rust language.

# Intended Outcomes

Running this program starts a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to:

* Select a fractal type to generate (e.g. Mandelbrot, Julia, Barnsley Fern, etc.)
* Enter or randomly generate inputs
* Configure and select a colour palette for the fractal
